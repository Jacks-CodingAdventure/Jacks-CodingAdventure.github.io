    <h3>Code Institute - 5 Day Coding Challenge</h3>
    <p>To start my coding adventure I have taken on Code Institutes - 5 Day Coding Challenge. This has helped me get to grips with the fundimentals of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
      I have been logging each challenge I have done and will upload then all once complete, including the main project which is a recipe webiste page for making tea.</p>
